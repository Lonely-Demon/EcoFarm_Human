Tech Stack Research: Mobile App Frameworks

Based on the MVP requirements (API integration, mapping, user accounts, community features, marketplace, noti?cations, multi-language) and future needs (IoT, AI, scalability), considering cost-e?ectiveness and performance:

Options:

1. React Native:

• Pros: Cross-platform (iOS & Android from one codebase - cost-e?ective), large community, vast library ecosystem (including mapping, UI kits aligning with GrowWise style), potentially faster development cycles, JavaScript/TypeScript based (large developer pool).

• Cons: Performance might lag behind native for highly complex animations or computations (less likely an issue for MVP), reliance on native bridges can sometimes add complexity.

• Scalability: Good. Mature framework used by large apps.
• AI/IoT: Good library support for API calls, background tasks, and potential native module integration for future hardware.

2. Flutter:

• Pros: Cross-platform (iOS & Android), excellent performance (compiles to native code), expressive UI toolkit (good for custom designs like GrowWise), growing community, developed by Google.

• Cons: Dart language (smaller developer pool than JS), ecosystem is newer than React Native (though rapidly growing).

• Scalability: Very good, designed for high performance.
• AI/IoT: Good support for API calls, growing support for IoT/native integrations.
3. Native iOS (Swift) & Android (Kotlin/Java):

• Pros: Best possible performance and access to native device features, latest OS updates immediately available.

• Cons: Requires separate development teams/e?orts for iOS and Android (signi?cantly higher cost and time), harder to maintain consistency.

• Scalability: Excellent platform-speci?c scalability.
• AI/IoT: Direct access to native SDKs for AI (CoreML, TensorFlow Lite) and hardware communication.

Recommendation Leaning:

For cost-e?ectiveness and rapid MVP development while maintaining good performance and scalability, React Native or Flutter are strong contenders.
• React Native might have a slight edge due to the larger developer pool and potentially more mature libraries for speci?c niche requirements.

• Flutter o?ers potentially better out-of-the-box performance and a highly ?exible UI system.

Native development is likely too costly for the initial phase given the budget constraints mentioned.

Next Step: Research backend technologies.
